      Time tracking is available via the Atto mobile app, via the web, or via the time clock kiosk.
    </p>
    <p>To start tracking your work hours on the app:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the Atto app</li>
      <li>Go to Time Clock</li>
      <li>Tap on the green “Clock In” button</li>
      <li>Your status will change to “On the Clock” and the timer will start running.</li>
      <li>When you’ve finished working, tap on the red “Clock Out” button.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      While on the clock, you can select job codes, take breaks and add notes to your time entry.

    Yes. You can track time with Atto’s time clock even if you don’t have an internet connection in
    your device. When you’re offline, a red banner that says “No Internet Connection” will appear at
    the top of your device’s screen. While offline, you can clock in & out, add/change jobs, start a
    break and add notes. Once your device reconnects to the internet, all account activity while
    offline will be synchronized online.

    <p>There are many benefits to consider, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Employees can track time from anywhere, even if they’re not based in an office</li>
      <li>You get greater accountability over their work activity</li>
      <li>
        With Atto, time clock data is automatically turned into timesheets, cutting admin and
        payroll time.
      </li>
      <li>Time recordings are much more accurate than with manual solutions</li>
      <li>GPS tracking can be used to get greater insights into worker productivity</li>
      <li>
        With reminder notifications, it’s harder for employees to forget to clock in at the
        start/end of their day.
      </li>
    </ul>
