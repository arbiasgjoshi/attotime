      Time tracking is available via the Atto mobile app, via the web, or via the time clock kiosk.
    </p>
    <p>To start tracking your work hours on the app:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the Atto app</li>
      <li>Go to Time Clock</li>
      <li>Tap on the green “Clock In” button</li>
      <li>Your status will change to “On the Clock” and the timer will start running.</li>
      <li>When you’ve finished working, tap on the red “Clock Out” button.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      While on the clock, you can select job codes, take breaks and add notes to your time entry.
    </p>

    Yes. You can track time with Atto’s time clock even if you don’t have an internet connection in
    your device. When you’re offline, a red banner that says “No Internet Connection” will appear at
    the top of your device’s screen. While offline, you can clock in & out, add/change jobs, start a
    break and add notes. Once your device reconnects to the internet, all account activity while
    offline will be synchronized online.

    <p>There are many benefits to consider, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Employees can track time from anywhere, even if they’re not based in an office</li>
      <li>You get greater accountability over their work activity</li>
      <li>
        With Atto, time clock data is automatically turned into timesheets, cutting admin and
        payroll time.
      </li>
      <li>Time recordings are much more accurate than with manual solutions</li>
      <li>GPS tracking can be used to get greater insights into worker productivity</li>
      <li>
        With reminder notifications, it’s harder for employees to forget to clock in at the
        start/end of their day.
      </li>
    </ul>
