      Time tracking is available via the Atto mobile app, via the web, or via the time clock kiosk.
    </p>
    <p>To start tracking your work hours on the app:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the Atto app</li>
      <li>Go to Time Clock</li>
      <li>Tap on the green “Clock In” button</li>
      <li>Your status will change to “On the Clock” and the timer will start running.</li>
      <li>When you’ve finished working, tap on the red “Clock Out” button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While on the clock, you can select job codes, take breaks, and add notes to your time entry.

    Yes. You can track time with Atto’s work hours tracker even if you don’t have an active internet
    connection. When you’re offline, a red banner that says “No Internet Connection” will appear at
    the top of your device’s screen. While offline, you can clock in & out, add/change jobs, start a
    break, and add notes. Once your device reconnects to the internet, all account activity while
    offline will be synchronized online.

    As soon as an employee enters or leaves a job site, or at their normal start and end time, Atto
    can send a reminder to clock-in and out. And if employees forget to track their time, they can
    add manual time card entries, which are flagged for review.
